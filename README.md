# Tech Radar
Our personal tech radar tracker.

We are experimenting Thoughtworks' concept of technology radar to keep track of our technology. More details about the terminology can be found here: https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq

An added or ring change for a radar item in a quarter is marked as "new" before being marked as not "new". This will help during review.

## Radar item status (rings)

1. Assess - getting a feeler for our needs and what the desired outcome might look
2. Trial - try out in production for a period of time with an acceptable amount of risk
3. Adopt - consensus that we should adopt as much as we can and encourage others to start using
4. Hold - consensus that the radar item is not a good fit

## Communication stages

1. Assess
   - Audience: All engineering.
   - Goals
     - Share vision, potential and/or needs.
     - Collect questions, concerns, and comments.
     - Health check.
2. Trial
   - Audience: All engineering.
   - Goals
     - Concise refresher on vision, potential and/or needs.
     - Share execution plan.
     - Collect questions, concerns, and comments.
3. Review radar items
   - TBD

## Review cadence

The platform team is responsible for scheduling and reviewing each radar item, which is planned to happen once per quarter.
